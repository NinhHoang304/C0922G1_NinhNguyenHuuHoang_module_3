                <p>Doraemon's physical appearance changed as the manga progressed.
                    At first, he was predominantly kingfish color, with a blue tail,
                    a white stomach, and flesh-colored hands and feet. He also stooped,
                    and had a body much larger than his head. In later issues, he sported
                    a smaller body, white hands and feet, and a red tail — the appearance
                    most identify him with today. In "The Doraemons" story arc
                    (and the 2112: The Birth of Doraemon short film), it is revealed that
                    Doraemon's original paint color was yellow. After getting his ears gnawed
                    off by a robot mouse at the 22nd century Nobi's residence, he slipped into
                    depression on top of a tower, where he erroneously drank a potion labeled
                    "sadness". As he wept, the yellow color washed off and his voice changed due
                    to the potion. As a result, he developed a morbid fear of mice despite being
                    a robotic cat. Doraemon often becomes enraged when he is mistaken for a raccoon
                    dog due to his missing ears, which is a running gag in the series.</p>
